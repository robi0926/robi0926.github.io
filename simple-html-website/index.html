        <p>My name is Alan, and I'm an interactive media student at Algonquin College who is passionate about both making and studying art. I appreciate discovering how things work, especially how to view things from a fresh perspective. I also relate to the well-known saying,<sup>[1]</sup><blackquote><strong>"I am seeking. I am striving. I am in it with all my heart."</strong>-<cite>Vincent van Gogh</cite></blackquote>. My path has brought me to Algonquin College, and I'm hoping that things can only get better from here. I always attempt to incorporate creativity and try to think out of the box in many things I try to do.</p>
        <p>Aside from my academic and professional activities, I enjoy reading, working out in the gym, and doing art and drawing. I also love traveling and engaging in outdoor activities like skating.My experiences have taught me that<sup>[2]</sup><blackquote><strong>"Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses."</strong>-<cite>Kobe Bryant</cite></blackquote>, and I'm always looking to develop and share my experiences to others.</p>
